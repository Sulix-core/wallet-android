===============

The Onixcoin Wallet is a fork of Coinomi, where we can store our ONIX, without sacrificing security. Private keys are stored in your own device. Using the words or mnemonic phrases you get a master key that can be memorized or stored on paper and then recover your funds at any time.

## Building the application

running, wallet-android navigating to where you cloned or downloaded and selecting
settings.gradle. When you have finished importing, click on the SDK Manager! [SDK Administrator] (https://developer.android.com/images/tools/sdk-manager-studio.png). You must install version 26 of the SDK.
